    "This code snippet conducts a statistical analysis to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in total claims across different provinces using a chi-squared test for independence. It begins by creating a contingency table that summarizes the counts of total claims segmented by province from the DataFrame df. The chi2_contingency function is then applied to this table to calculate the chi-squared statistic and the associated p-value. The significance level (alpha) is set at 0.05, which is a common threshold for determining statistical significance. \n",

Conversely, if the p-value is greater than or equal to alpha, the null hypothesis is accepted, suggesting no significant difference in claims across the provinces. This analysis helps in understanding the distribution of claims geographically and informs potential resource allocation or intervention strategies."
