## Project Overview

The ACIS Data Analysis Project aims to leverage statistical methods and machine learning techniques to analyze various datasets related to insurance claims, customer demographics, and policy performance. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Tools to clean and prepare raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistics to summarize the data and uncover hidden patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning models to predict customer behavior and claim outcomes.
- **Reporting:** Generating reports for stakeholders to facilitate data-driven decisions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jerusalem-Fetene/Week3.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Week3
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. Data Preparation:
   * Place your datasets in the data/ directory.
2. Run Analysis:
   * Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform EDA and modeling:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
3. Generate Reports:
   * Use the reporting scripts in the reports/ directory to create visualizations and summaries.
## Data Sources
Claims Data: Historical claims data from the ACIS database.
Customer Demographics: Information on customer profiles and behavior.
Policy Data: Details regarding insurance policies and their performance.
